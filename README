Remember Your Mortality

This is an Android app and widget that appears on your home screen to tell you about how many days you have left to live.

The app will ask you to enter your birthday and how many years you expect to live. A link to Wikipedia's average life expectancy rates by country can help to determine this.

Then simply add the Memento Mori widget to your home screen.
